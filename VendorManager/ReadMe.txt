These features should be added when sometime can be allocated

Select Vendor
When we click Add new vendor, currently we must enter a new vendor name and select a product. We can also create a product on the same screen. However on this same screen we need to be able to choose an existing vendor
An existing vendor can provide service for this product. Actually this screen does not add a vendor only, it adds a vendor and associate it to a product in vendor product table
